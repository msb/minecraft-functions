# Minecraft Function Generation

This is a Python package for generating Minecraft functions that allow players to enhance their
builds.

## Generating Custom Functions with Python

Minecraft custom functions are simply a list of commands with no other programming constructs. I
have starting experimenting with generating these functions using python scripts. For example,
this project contains `domes.py` that generates a set of functions that create glass domes with
varying sizes and colours. A container has been provided with the required python libraries and can
be built and run with `docker-compose`:

```sh
# dome
docker-compose run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) dome-java

# ring
docker-compose run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) ring-java

# cloudtree
docker-compose run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) cloudtree-java

# maze
docker-compose run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) cloudtree-java
```

The dome/ring size and material can be varied by editing the configuration files. 
Also bedrock versions of the functions can be generated by swapping in the `-bedrock` suffix (if available):

```sh
# dome
docker-compose run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) dome-bedrock
```

## Copying structures between worlds.

As you can't easily copy/paste structures between bedrock worlds, a tool has been developed to scan
a world for structure blocks and converts the structures of any it finds to a set of bedrock
functions as follows:

```sh
minecraftfunctions structure bedrock $PATH_TO_BEDROCK_WORLD $PATH_FOR_BEDROCK_FUNCTIONS $PWD/config/structure.bedrock.yaml
```
